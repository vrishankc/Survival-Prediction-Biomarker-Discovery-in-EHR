# Survival-Prediction-Biomarker-Discovery-in-EHR
An integrative algorithm for survival prediction via biomarker discovery in patients' structured clinical EHR narratives.

In-hospital mortality is devastating for patients; yet, such events can be prevented through early diagnosis. Due to the poor characterization of in-hospital mortality predictors, I developed an integrative algorithmic approach that transforms structured clinical narratives form patient EHR into clinically-approved biomarkers for survival prediction. The model received an AUROC of 0.87, which significantly outperformed all existing clinical techniques.
